I am a PhD student at the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc. I received my B. Sc. in Life Science from Gargi College, University of Delhi and my M. Sc. in Biotechnology from IIT Roorkee. I am interested in how the brain makes decisions when faced with many choices and little information about their outcomes. To investigate this, I use tools from the fields of reinforcement learning and systems neuroscience.
