I joined the Centre for Neuroscience as a Ph.D. student in August 2022. I transitioned from making tobacco products a few years back to working on the same molecule it mimics in the brain. I completed my BTech in Chemical Engineering from IIT-Bombay and thereafter worked at ITC Ltd. for two years. A leap of faith brought me to Neuroscience at NCBS-TIFR, where I delved into adult hippocampal neurogenesis using molecular biology tools like immunostaining, confocal microscopy, and (failed) tissue cultures. I am intrigued by how biology orchestrates a fascinating range of learning behaviors and adaptations. In the lab, I want to uncover trial-and-error strategies for motor learning using automated behavioural training and monitoring, cutting-edge brain recording and manipulation tools, and computational modelling.
