I joined the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc as a PhD student in August 2023. I completed my B.E. in Biotechnology from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi and my MTech in Biotechnology from IIT Guwahati. A foray into analysing brain activity using electroencephalogram tickled my interest in neuroscience a few years ago. I am currently interested in understanding motor learning and how motor skills are acquired via reinforcement learning.
