Ashesh Dhawale is an Assistant Professor at the Centre for Neuroscience in the Indian Institute of Science. He received his PhD from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bangalore, where he worked with Upi Bhalla to investigate neural coding in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. He then completed postdoctoral training with Bence Ã–lveczky lab at Harvard University, where he investigated the role of the basal ganglia in the execution of learned motor sequences and developed automated techniques to track neural activity recorded in behaving rodents over months-long timescales relevant to motor skill learning.
