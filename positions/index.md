### PhD Students

Given the interdiscplinary nature of our work, we encourage excellent students from a variety of backgrounds to apply. We cannot admit PhD students directly to our lab; interested candidates may apply to the [Centre for Neuroscience PhD program](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/academics/phd-program/) or the IISc [Integrated PhD program](https://iisc.ac.in/admissions/ph-d-integratedprogrammes/) in Biological Sciences. Students can also apply to the interdiscplinary [Brain and AI PhD program](https://brain-computation.iisc.ac.in/opportunities/).

### Undergraduate Researchers

We accept 1-2 trainees every year primarily from the IISc undergraduate program. Due to this, we cannot usually accomodate short-term interns from other programs. <br>
Students interested in doing their BS/MS thesis projects in the lab may [contact](/contact) us. Please note that, due to Institute policy, we cannot offer funding and accomodation to non-IISc students pursuing their thesis projects in the lab.

Since we get hundreds of requests every year for internships, we apologize if  we cannot respond to every email we recieve. 

### Research Assistants

Currently, we have no funding available for Research Assistants.

### Postdoctoral Researchers

Currently, we have no lab funding for postdoctoral fellows. However, qualified candidates with a strong interest in systems neuroscience can apply for their own funding from several [sources](https://indiabioscience.org/postdocs/grants) including from [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/post-docs/). Please [contact](/contact) us if you are interested in doing a postdoc in the lab.
