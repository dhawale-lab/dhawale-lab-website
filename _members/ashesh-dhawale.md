I received my undergraduate training in Life Sciences and Biochemistry at St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai. My doctoral research was on sensory coding in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, supervised by Upi Bhalla at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bangalore. During my PhD, I also collaborated closely with Dinu Albeanu at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to develop optogenetic approaches to study olfactory circuits. During my postdoctoral training with Bence Ölveczky at Harvard University, supported by Life Sciences Research Foundation and Charles A. King Trust fellowships, I developed new experimental platforms to study how the brain learns and executes skilled movements.
