### Postdoctoral Researchers

Currently, we have no grant funding for Postdoctoral Fellows. However, qualified candidates with a strong interest in systems neuroscience may apply for external funding from several [sources](https://indiabioscience.org/postdocs/grants), including [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/post-docs/). Please [contact](/contact) us if you are interested in doing a postdoc in the lab.

### PhD Students

Given the interdiscplinary nature of our work, we encourage excellent students from a variety of backgrounds to apply. We cannot admit PhD students directly to our lab. Interested candidates should apply to the [Centre for Neuroscience PhD program](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/academics/phd-program/) or the IISc [Integrated PhD program](https://iisc.ac.in/admissions/ph-d-integratedprogrammes/) in Biological Sciences. Students may also apply to the interdiscplinary [Brain and AI PhD program](https://brain-computation.iisc.ac.in/opportunities/).


### Research/Project Assistants

At present, we have no openings for Research Assistants.


### Undergraduate Researchers

We accept 1-2 trainees every year primarily from the IISc undergraduate program.  We typically cannot accomodate additional interns from other programs. <br>
Students interested in doing their BS/MS thesis projects in the lab may [contact](/contact) us. Please note that, due to Institute policy, we cannot offer funding and accomodation to non-IISc students who wish to do their thesis research in the lab.
